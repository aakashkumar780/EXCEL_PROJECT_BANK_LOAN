## ðŸ“Œ Objective:

The objective of this project is to analyze sales performance data using Excel to identify key business insights. The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of revenue, profit, customer behavior, and product trends, enabling data-driven decision-making. It helps stakeholders track KPIs, monitor regional and category-wise performance, and uncover opportunities for growth and efficiency improvement.


## ðŸ“Œ Top 5 Insights got from this project :

1. Sales Performance â€“ The majority of sales revenue is driven by a few top-performing product categories, while some categories contribute very little, indicating the need to focus on high-margin products.

2. Regional Analysis â€“ Certain regions  consistently generate higher sales compared to others, showing geographical strengths and untapped markets.

3. Profitability Trends â€“ Not all high-sales categories are equally profitable; some products with strong sales volume show low or negative profit margins, signaling areas to review pricing/discount strategy.

4. Customer Segment Contribution â€“ A specific customer segment (e.g., Corporate or Consumer) dominates total sales, suggesting targeted marketing campaigns can maximize revenue.

5. Seasonality / Time Trend â€“ Sales show clear fluctuations across months/quarters, highlighting peak seasons where businesses can increase inventory and promotional efforts.
